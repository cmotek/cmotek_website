# cmotek_website
project website

This is an HTML/CSS/Javascript (with a PHP email function) that I built as a portfolio website. I liked the look when I made it, but it feels a little old now. I really want to create a new website that's really just kind of an idea-card portfolio where I can maybe keep a blog of my work in technology and what I'm learning as well as updates on different projects. So this may stay the same and the cmotek.com of the future will look entirely different. 

One should be able to pull the repository down and run the website simply by opening the index page in a browser locally, but the email page will not work due to it's being in PHP. So may have to configure a program to run PHP locally on your machine if you want to see the entire website or you can just visit it on the web.
