    <div><p id="readscript">One thing I have been wisely warned about is that if prospective employers check out my Github page and my code is not clean, that's an easy no to a potential job candidate. I have several projects done in Javascript (node.js), PHP (Code Igniter), and Python (Django), but I wanted to go back and review those frameworks and see if I could refactor or improve them.</p></div>    
    <div><p id="readscript">Otherwise, overall I may consider pruning my Github of some of my less interesting early lessons. But to begin, I have to begin another place. I really wanted to get a reading of Clean Code by Roger Martin under my belt, as it's pretty much software developer canon.</p></div>  
    <div><p id="readscript">And to begin with Clean Code, I realized I really needed to begin with Java. Having blown up a runthrough of Kent Beck's Test Driven Development last month, I realize that I need to get as comfortable as I can with Java in the Eclipse environment. To that end, I have purchased a copy of Murach's Java in the Eclipse environment.</p></div>  
    <div><p id="readscript">A lot of software engineer/software development books work in Java, so it's a language I want to improve upon. I'm also interested in upping my fluency to use a Java frame (I'm thinking Swing) for putting together a software that houses my family's photo albums (more on that later).</p></div>
