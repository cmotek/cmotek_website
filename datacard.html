        <div><p id="readscript">I begin at a brick wall. Having struggled with Leetcode problems in the past, I realized that in order to pass a technical interview, I was going to need to ingrain Data Structures and Algorithms into my nerve endings. I set a goal of studing DS&A from several different angles and then seeing if I couldn't reapply myself to Leetcode problems and learn some succinct techniques to solving them. </p></div>
        <div><p id="readscript">To this end, I have acquired several resources at the suggestion of a couple of great developers that I know. Since Python is my testing language of choice, I acquired Dr. Basant Agarwal's and Benjamin Baka's "Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python". So far I am really enjoying this one as I think the examples are direct and fleshed out with details about memory allocation and time complexity.</p></div>
        <div><p id="readscript">Other resources I have grabbed include Sammie Bae's "Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms, Algorithms: Notes for Professionals (A Goalkicker Workbook), and Kurt Melhorn's seemingly impenetrable "Algorithms and Data Structures: The Basic Toolbox". Glossing the mathematical notation in the last option made me feel like refraining from the act of thinking all together.</p></div>
        <div><p id="readscript">I also am continuing to work out of John Zelle's "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" as a resource I acquired while studying at Seattle Central College. Great little book with straightforward examples and computer science details dovetailing with such. I am going to try and finish every exercise in this one, although I won't do that for every text I read, as that would leave less time for building projects for my portfolio.</p></div>
