    <div><p id="readscript">When I initially thought about how to compose my portfolio website I wanted to put together something that was simple and sharp looking.  I wanted to show that I could create an effective static website, a basic sense of command with HTML/CSS, responsive design, and was congenial with principles of UX and Clean Code. I also wanted to create something that I could use for a long time, that would be a good sandbox for various projects, and would allow me to personalize my path towards becoming a developer.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I wanted the site to be composed of a few, easily manipulated elements. I chose a background image that I grabbed from the internet and tinted.  It was an image of the Seattle Central Library that I thought evoked the complexity and elegance of the work of writing code. </p></div> 
    <div><img id="forgeimg" src="images/seattle.jpg"></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">Next, I hopped online and found a design for a logo on Youtube that I wanted to use and could recreate via GIMP (which has to be the most poorly named application in human history). The design worked well and its color would complement the color of my tinted background (also done in GIMP).</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I affixed the logo on top of a banner, and I ended up with a design that I thought was pretty sharp.  I adjusted the attributes of the elements so that my subsequent pages would layout narrative text and images and I thought I was in pretty good shape.</p></div>
    <div><img id="hiccupimg" src="images/hiccupone.png"></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">My first hiccup occurred when I tried to lay out my navigation bar.  Only the link furthest away from my logo would work.  I ultimately realized that the transparent background on my logo was laying on top of my links, so I pared it down.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I created a simple card structure for my "Forge" where I could layout my personal projects.  Each card on the Forge would be a link to a text and image narrative of the build. The easy first pick for the CMOTEK website. I also made all the webpages responsive.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">The contact page was an endeavor. I installed and configured an email functionality (PHP Mailer) so that I could receive email messages at my Gmail account.  Then, in order for my contact page to render an appropriate success message, I had to reconfigure my PHP email functionality as it was impairing reciept of my JSON "Success" message, when the email was received at my Gmail account.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I tried to get everything as responsive as possible, and I cleaned up my code of little jokes and nonsense words that seem to emanate from my being when I code.</p></div>
