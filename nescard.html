    <div><p id="readscript">This is the dessert project. My first hardware project. There are so many incredible examples of customized flashy videogame consoles online I had to try my hand at my own. And I picked my heartsong videogame system, the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I want it to have a white glossy top with jet black paint along the bottom, a pink ON light, and maybe a wooden base. The controllers will be ideally wireless and also placed in wood moldings. I want it to have a video quality upgrade, an audio quality upgrade, possibly a Japanese translator, and the Blinking Light win fix, which corrects start up issues from bent connector pins. </p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">The only thing I have been unable to decide if I will try is an upgrade to the Zap gun, of which there are a few albeit somewhat haphazardly made examples of Zap guns built to work on HD televisions that you can find on the internet.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I also want it to contain every NES game on one cartridge. I'll probably order the NES that I plan to use next week and try and follow up the following week by purchasing a soldering kit that I can use for the video upgrade I'm planning which seems to be the most technically difficult portion of the whole project besides the controllers (which I literally I have no idea how I'm going to do as I have never done woodworking in any capacity in my entire life.</p></div>
