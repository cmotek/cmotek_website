    <p id="readscript">As a former student and in my personal life, reading is the primary mode by which I learn.  I take great satisfaction in reading stories and non-fiction.  I find this practice to be relaxing and meditative.  Below is a grouping of books I have read on my path to becoming a better programmer.  These books have shaped me as a thinker and helped me to engage in a culture with other developers and programmers.  Any book listed below can be presumed to have been read cover to cover by me.  For any workbook with exercises listed below, it can be assumed that I have worked through every exercise in said bookâ€”which can be found on my Github page.</p>
