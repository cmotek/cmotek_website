    <div><p id="readscript"> My grandfather wrote an autobiography. It includes my genealogy, letters from relatives living and passed, the story of his own life, and his thoughts on day to day life in America. It's 800 pages long. And I want to build a small software application in a Java framework, likely Swing, in order to house and share it with my family members.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript"> I wanted to build a small software to sort the pages of the biography, which my grandfather wrote in a beautiful scrawl on unlined paper. So the program will have to be able to manipulate large .png files. What I see in my head has the veneer or layout of a booted up Playstation 4 where the covers of videogames would be the pages of the autobiography.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript"> I would like to be able to share this with my extended family, and I want the application to have a search function that allows my family members to find themselves in the pages of my grandfather's story. A rendering of a family tree would be awesome as well. Maybe a good time to practice a tree data structure. I would also like to maybe arrange the pages in different ways, like chronologically, or by family, or by the order that he wrote the volumes in.</p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript"> So I want to start by thinking about the specifications of an application that would have the muscle to manipulate these large .pngs, be cross-platform, and to have a sense of each .png as an object with values that can be manipulated by various functions to creatively render the book. </p></div>
