    <div><p id="readscript">This project is my dream frame project. I want to build a website that houses my reviews of horror movies. I would like to call it Big T's Spooky Castle.<p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">I've found that horror movies overall have attracted some interesting critical analysis but it mostly exists in the academic world and additionally, movie review websites often are made to advise someone of whether or not the should see a movie or aggregate thin user reviews. There are so many weird movies out there that I think would blossom under critical analysis, besides the obvious critical darling art house movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Alien.<p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">So it's a movie review website for people who already watch horror movies and want to read thoughtful thoughts about them. As I'm still getting used to using frames on my own, and I wanted to continue to learn Python, so I'm working on my first Flask frame.<p></div>
    <div><p id="readscript">The only thing I worry about is that I want the website to have a visually heavy look and I'm hoping that Flask (known for being easy to rollout and very customizable in terms of extensions and add-ons) will be a good fit. <p></div>
